# Advent Of Code 2021

Every year, I end up adding some extra challenges/projects for myself, for funsies. To make it easier for my future self I'm listing them here
## Golfs\*:
- Day 1 (Combined): [97 bytes](day1/day1golf.py)

\* <super>Under my personal rules for this, input must read from a file called "day\*.txt". Golfs can do one or both parts, which will be specified with the filename. Byte counts com from `wc -c`, an files have LF line endings</super>
## Graphical Versions:
Trying something new this year, using LÃ¶ve.
previously i'd end up spending forever trying to
figure out weird things with `tkinter` or other
python builtins.
If you have it installed you should be able to run each of the files with just `love day*.lua`
- [Day 2, Part 1](day2/main.lua)
