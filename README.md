# Advent Of Code 2021

Every year, I end up adding some extra challenges/projects for myself, for funsies. To make it easier for my future self I'm listing them here
## Golfs[^1]:
- Day 1 (Combined): [97 bytes](day1/day1golf.py)
- Day 2 (Part 1): [101 bytes](day2/day2golf.py)

[^1]: Under my personal rules for this, input must read from a file called "day\*.txt". Golfs can do one or both parts, which will be specified with the filename. Byte counts com from `wc -c`, and files have LF line endings
## Graphical Versions:
Trying something new with my visualizations this year, using LÃ¶ve.
previously I'd end up spending forever trying to
figure out weird things with `tkinter` or other
python builtins.
If you have it installed you should be able to run each of the files with just `love day*.lua`
